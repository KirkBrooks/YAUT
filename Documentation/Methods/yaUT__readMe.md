## Yet Another Unit Test

This component gives you several levels of unit testing within your 4D app ranging from a simple class you can use to create unit tests on the fly while you work up to a full test suite that can be run in headless mode as part of a build action. 

The reccommended strategy is to write unit test methods. If you prefix the method name with **yaUT_** you can run them from the yaUT Main Form as well as from the **yaUT_FullTest** method. 

### Use the Macro to setup test methods



### The UnitTest class

Available as `.yaUT.UnitClass` this is the basis for all testing. See the documentation for the class for details.
